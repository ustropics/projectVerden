[AutoRepair]

## Timer in seconds on how often auto repair is applied if the player has an according item (see in categories). Disabled if value is zero. Low values not adviced.
# Setting type: UInt32
# Default value: 120
Timer = 0

[Category]

## Number of additional categories for which damage reductions may be defined. Remark: You can use a category to exclude structures from another category. Each structure can always be in only one category and they are tested zero first, ..., default last
# Setting type: UInt32
# Default value: 1
NumberOfCategories = 1

[Category0]

## What is used to determine if a structure in inside this category. Options: 'structureName', 'material', 'none'. In '[CategoryDefault]' this is always 'none'.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: structureName
type = structureName

## Names of the structure(s) in this category.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: raft,karve,vikingship,littleboat,cargoship,bigcargoship
StructureName = raft,karve,vikingship,littleboat,cargoship,bigcargoship

## Only used in game with logging enabled. Though I advice naming your categories for clarity
# Setting type: String
# Default value: Ships
name = Ships

## Determines whether this group only applies to structures build by any player. Be aware, that if this is false, this may include beehives or other structures that you actually want to destroy.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
OnlyPlayerStructures = true

## Global keys that apply modifiers. First applicable key will be used. Example values: defeated_eikthyr,defeated_gdking,defeated_bonemass,defeated_dragon,defeated_goblinking,defeated_MourningQueen,KilledJotunn,defeated_damnedone
# Setting type: String
# Default value: defeated_damnedone,KilledJotunn,defeated_MourningQueen,defeated_goblinking
GlobalKeysNames = Killed_HelDemon

## Damage multipliers per name. First applicable multiplier will be used. This list should have the same length as 'GlobalKeysNames'. Values that cannot be converted to a float will be ignored. Values below zero would repair a structure and are not adviced. Below one reduces damage to structures. Above one will increase damage.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 0.01,0.2,0.3,0.5
GlobalKeysMultipliers = 0.2

## 'Token name' of items that apply modifiers if in player inventory. See https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Wiki/wiki/ObjectDB-Table for vanilla items. You can use 'structuredamagetweaks inventory' ingame to print a full list of 'Token names' for what is currently in your inventory. First applicable item with an actuall effect (see below) in this list will be used.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: Yagluth thing
ItemInInventoryRequirements = 

## Damage multipliers per item. First applicable multiplier that is unequal to '1' will be used. This list should have the same length as 'ItemInInventoryRequirements'. Missing or non-float-convertable ones will be set to '1', i.e. no effect. Values below zero would repair a structure and are not adviced. Below one reduces damage to structures. Above one will increase damage.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 0.5
ItemInInventoryMultipliers = 

## Amount of auto-repair per item. All structures in range will be repaired by this percentage every '[AutoRepair]Timer' seconds. First applicable non-zero value will be used. This list should have the same length as 'ItemInInventoryRequirements', missing entries will be set to zero, i.e. no effect.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 5
ItemInInventoryAutoRepairPercentage = 

## Range per item.Checked per structure.This is a restriction as to when an item is 'applicable', see above.This list should have the same length as 'ItemInInventoryRequirements', missing entries will be set to the maximum given range, or '10' should the whole list be empty.Different items with different ranges can work together if ordered correctly: Put strong short range items first.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 100
ItemInInventoryRange = 

[CategoryDefault]

## Only used in game with logging enabled. Though I advice naming your categories for clarity
# Setting type: String

[Logging]

## Enable logging. Please be aware, that enabling this together with auto repair will slow your game each time auto repair is performed if you are in a region with many instances that are in need of repairs.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Logging Enabled = false
