Mod to assist with large scale farming in Valheim

When pressing the configured hotkey (default Left Shift or Left Bumper on controller) the player will automatically harvest all pickupable items of the same type in a radius around the target. This is mainly intended for assisting with farming, but also works on world spawn pickups like rocks/sticks/berries.

Additionally, when planting crops, if the hotkey is held will plant in a grid around the original target (5x5 default grid size).
