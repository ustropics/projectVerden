THIS UPLOAD IS NOT FROM DEFENDYOURBASE
I'm just uploading a few mods that I found on Nexus and enjoyed to make it easier for my friends to download and use them, nothing more, please show your appreciation or ask your questions/report bugs to the person who made this mod directly through his Nexus account.

Here is a stack of supplemental raids to be used with the mod Custom Raids by ASharpPen. Raids are based on biome and worldprogress and is separated by wild raids and base raids. Wild raids can happen anywhere on the map including your base while Base raids only happen near your base. Bosses can spawn in certain base raids and the wild Eikythyr raid, if goblinking is defeated and environmental conditions are met so they are not always going to be spawning. Raids timers and chances are individually set within supplemental raid files.
