# RRR Core

- Core library required by all of my other mods.

## Setup

Extract the zip file to your `Valheim\BepInEx` folder. Config files should end up in `Valheim\BepInEx\config`, everything else should end up in `Valheim\BepInEx\plugins`. Config files will also be generated automatically if missing.

## Help!

If you need further assistance, feel free to bug me in the Valheim Modding Discord at https://discord.gg/RBq2mzeu4z
