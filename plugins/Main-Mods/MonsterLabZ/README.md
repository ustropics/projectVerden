        Version 1.7
            Added the mythical KRAKEN! Probably undefeatable but oh well. Enjoy!
        Version 1.6.1
            Configs and animation Data will be a separate download from now on as a modders resource. Added 2 new bronze pieces of armor for Goblin. Added Silkworm Butterfly. Fixed Goblins not being able to swim.
        Version 1.6
            Added ObsidianGolem, Rainbow_Butterfly, GoblinLoot, GoblinBase, GoblinShamanNew, Goblins armor will not scale in size. Must stay original size for armor. Fixed Molluscan_Taunt not working in Json.
        Version 1.5
            Added new crab creature for ocean, the Molluscan! New Greydwarf variant. Spiders tilt with terrain now. Redid firegolem graphics a little.
        Version 1.4
            Added new giant IceGolem that you can run between his legs and hack at them. Legs have limited collision so you can get knocked away occasionally. He will mess you up careful. Fixed borked JSON for the forestspider. Also fixed some VFX errors.
        Version 1.3
            Added 6 more new spider variants. Added foot step FX and sfx. Added Ashlands Skeleton and Northern Skeleton. If you are currently spawning the BlackSpider you will need to switch to new one. BlackSpider has a short lifespan ;)
        Version 1.2
            Added FrostSpider with gibbing ragdoll, GhostWarrior, SkeletonWarrior. Customize Skeletons and Ghosts even more than before.
        Version 1.1
            Hopefully fixed the Valheim.exe error on dedicated servers. Added a new super basic spider model. Redid firegolem fire to reduce frame rate loss. Had to restart my Unity from scratch after some huge corruption. Hopefully everything should be preserved.
        Version 1.0
            Initial release
