##Additional Credit:

Furok and Grim Age mod team created the original models and textures used in this mod, I just re-rigged the model and did some other tweaks for use in Valheim. Grim Age is a mod based on Warhammer Fantasy, and as such should be considered a Derivative Work to which Games Workshop holds copyright to. Games Workshop's copyright thus extends to the models and textures used in this mod.

##Description:

Adds Chaos Warrior Armor as a new standalone set of armor to the game. Armor names and descriptions are kept fairly vague and don't outright refer to anything from Warhammer lore, if that matters to you. 

Low-res texture version available in optional files on Nexus. 

Recipes can be viewed and adjusted in ReepusDeepusDelmeepus4902761.ChaosArmor.cfg.

4.0.1
- added cold resist to chestpiece
- rebuilt assembly from new project yet again
- low res texture version available on Nexus, just overwrite ChaosArmor.dll with the .dll provided in that optional file; texture replacement should be client-side and the rest of the code is up-to-date with main file

- rebuilt dll from new project, praying to god this stamps out any assembly loading issues; will retain loose assetbundle version on Nexus for some time in case not

- adjusted recipe/upgrade amounts to be more varied
- small mesh adjustments:
  - covered up a small gap between the right arm and breastplate with filler material
  - positioned helmet further forward to closer match player character posture (no longer clips with head in character select screen)
- bunch of cool changes courtesy of zarboz
  - mesh rigging of body matches player posture much better now - unfortunately not enough to prevent clipping, hence Blacksmith's tools remains a requirements
  - on-equip status effects with a special cheesy message for each armor piece, see Gear Stats Breakdown for more details

2.0.1:
- assetbundle now in .dll as an embedded resource, should work when running from mod managers now
